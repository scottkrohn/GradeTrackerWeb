        <p>I made Personal Gradebook a free web application to help students keep track of their weighted grades. 
        It always drove me crazy when using grading platforms like Blackboard and Canvas that the grade shown
        online typically wasn't your actual weighted grade. It was up to the instructor of the course to set
        up the weight categories and input the assignment grades correctly, which usually didn't happen. Because
        of this the grade you see online is typically a simple points earned divided by points possibie score, which
        isn't very useful in a weighted grade course.

        Personal Gradebook allows the student to input their own custom weight categories for a course, then add assignments
        to those categories. It presents the student with their current weighted grade as opposed to unweighted grade.
        I also wanted to give students the option to have a final grade calculator that can calcuate what score they need
        on their final exam without having to do your own weighted grade calculation.
        It's free, super easy to use and really helpful.
